Functional Description
The following chapter describes the software functionality. This section outlines the primary objectives, behavior, and expected outcomes of the module being designed. The functionality is implemented to ensure reliable communication between different layers of the system and to meet specific requirements such as performance, safety, and resource efficiency.

Implementation of the Module
This chapter discusses the detailed design of the module. It covers the architectural decisions, algorithms used, and the overall structure of the code. Key functions, their purposes, and interactions are described to give insight into the internal workings of the module. This section also highlights any trade-offs made in terms of performance, memory usage, or simplicity of implementation.

Integration and Configuration
Static Files
Typically, a module consists of C and H files, but other file types may exist. Below is a list of all the files that form part of this module:

File name	Contents
abc_xxx.c	Source code file, contains core logic
abc.h	Export Interface file, defines functions exposed to other modules
abci.h	Import and Module Configuration file, contains internal configurations
Include Structure
If there is a complex file structure, such as multiple C files or numerous header files, use a diagram to explain the relationships between source and dependent include files. Below is a PlantUML diagram illustrating this structure:

plantuml
Copy code
@startuml
package "pkg" {
    [ABC_Init.c].>[ADC.h] : includes
    [ABC_Init.c]...>[ABCi.h]
    [ABC_Task.c]...>[ADC.h]
    [ABC_Task.c]...>[ABCi.h] : includes
    interface Interf3
    note left of ABC_Task.c: A top note
    ABC_Init.c ..> Interf3 : internal interface
}

Configuration
This section details any required hardware/software or system configurations that can be adjusted via a header file. Configuration settings can include parameters related to system tuning, hardware specifications, or specific operational modes. These values can be adjusted as per system requirements.

Name	Value range	Description
MAX_VALUE	0 to 255	Maximum allowable value for the counter or system
TIMEOUT	1 ms to 1000 ms	Timeout duration for communication or task delay
ENABLE_DEBUG	0 or 1	Enables or disables debugging logs in the system
This structure outlines the key sections and how they fit together to describe the module's software design, implementation, and integration. Each section provides necessary details to support the development, testing, and configuration of the system, ensuring its successful deployment in a larger project.
